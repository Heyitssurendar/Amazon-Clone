# ✨Amazon-Clone✨

<P>
I developed a front-end Amazon clone website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replicate the core features of the Amazon marketplace.
The website includes:
🛒 Engaging product listings with images, prices, and ratings.
🔎 A completely functional navigation bar with search features.
📁 Product category filters for easy navigation and enhanced shopping.
🖥️ A sleek, intuitive layout that mimics the Amazon design.
📲 Responsive design ensuring smooth performance on both desktop and mobile devices.<br>
This project showcases my ability to rebuild complex, real-world interfaces while keeping responsiveness and a user-friendly design at the forefront.
