# Amazon-Clone

<P>
I developed a front-end Amazon clone website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replicate the core features of the Amazon marketplace
The website includes
🛍️ Interactive product listings with images, prices, and ratings.
🔍 A fully functional navigation bar with search capabilities.
📂 Product category filters for a seamless shopping experience.
💻 A clean, intuitive layout replicating the familiar Amazon design.
📱 Responsive design for smooth performance across desktop and mobile devices.
This project demonstrates my ability to recreate complex, real-world interfaces while ensuring responsiveness and a user-friendly design.
